excerpt: Led identity strategy at Elsevier, making access easier for millions of scientists while contributing to SeamlessAccess and privacy initiatives.

As **Product Director for Identity** at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com), I led a multi-year programme that brought together dozens of globally significant products, making access easier for millions of scientists, clinicians and students all over the world.

I contributed to the [SeamlessAccess](https://seamlessaccess.org) project, spoke at conferences and on panels, and helped transform the Elsevier privacy strategy.
